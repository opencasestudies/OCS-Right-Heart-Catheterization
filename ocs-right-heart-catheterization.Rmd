# Motivation

[Right heart catheterization (RHC)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/right_heart_catheterization_135,40), also known as pulmonary artery 
catheterization, can be used to see how well or poorly a 
patient's heart is pumping or to measure the 
pressure in a patient's heart and lungs. Broadly, 
the procedure guides a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter 
(a small and hollow tube) through the pulmonary artery 
and into the right chambers of the heart. Here is the
video to help describe in more detail how it works.

However, it is often the case that when a foreign object 
enters the human body, there is the risk of infection. RHC
is no different. When the tube is put into the artery and 
a dye is injected into the heart, potential complications 
include the rupture of pulmonary artery or arrythmias of 
the heart where the heart may skip a beat. 

To evaluate the benefit of RHCs, one approach is to use a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT). However, because of the 
widespread belief that RHCs are beneficial and safe, it 
makes it difficult to use RCTs. Without RCTs of RHCs,
another approach to evaluate its effectiveness is an
observational study. 

The motivation of this case study is to investigate 
whether or not there is an impact on a patient's overall 
survival (or mortality) due to the use of a patient being 
treated with a RHC in an observational dataset. 

Our main predictor of interest is RHC, but we also want 
to adjust for all other potential confounders in the dataset 
as this is an observational study. Here, we want to know 
whether RHC actually improves the patient's overall survival 
within 30 days of being given a RHC, but adjusted by other
baseline variables, including age, race, blood pressure, etc.

In addition to loading the set of R packages from the
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) that we will use 
for data manipulation, exploration and visualization, we also 
use the following R packages and describe their purpose 
for this this particular case study:

|R package|Purpose|
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`tableone`|Creates a table ('Table 1' below) to describe baseline characteristics of the population|
|`kableExtra`|Helps with building complex tables and manipulating table styles; creates awesome HTML tables|
|`broom`|Takes the messy output of built-in functions in R such as `lm` or `t.test`, and turns it into tidy data frames|
|`ggpubr`|Provides some easy-to-use functions for creating and customizing `ggplot2`- based publication ready plots|
|`ggfortify`|Data visualization tools for statistical analysis result|
|`gridExtra`|Provides a number of user-level functions to work with "grid" graphics|
|`ggplot2`|Create elegant data visualisations using the grammar of graphics|
|`survival`|Contains the core survival analysis routines, including definition of `Surv` objects, Kaplan-Meier and Cox models etc.|
|`survminer`|Drawing Survival Curves using 'ggplot2'|
|`knitr`|Provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R|
|`MatchIt`|Nonparametric preprocessing for parametric causal inference|

In order to run this code please ensure you have these packages installed. 

```{r,warning = F}
library(tableone)
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggfortify)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(knitr)
library(MatchIt)
```


The learning objectives for this case study include:

  * some basic data wrangling and visualizations (using the `tidyverse` packages)
  * a causal inference method: propensity score matching (using the `MatchIt` package)
  * multivariate logistic regression (using `stats` package)
  * survival analysis (using `survival` package)

# What is the data?

The data are available to download as a `.csv` at this
[link](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.csv). 
The dataset includes a set of patients who were hospitialized
and either did or did not received an RHC (also called the 
Swan-Ganz catheter) on day 1 of hospitalization. This
treatment variable in the dataset is called `swang1`. 
The description of all variables can be found in
[codebook](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html).


# Data Import

As the data are avaiable online, we will import data 
from the web directly with `read_csv()` function from the 
[`readr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/readr.pdf) 
as part of the `tidyverse`. This dataset was 
originally used in in this paper [@Connors_1996],
and has been made publicly available.

```{r}
file <- "http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.csv"
rhc <- read_csv(file)
```

Let's take a quick look at the first 
five rows and five columns of the dataset: 

```{r}
rhc[1:5, 1:5]
```

To get a sense of how many observations or columns 
we have, we can use the `dim()` function: 

```{r}
dim(rhc)
```

We will talk more about what the column names mean
in the next section. 

# Data Wrangling

## Variable selection

As we saw, there are in total `r ncol(rhc)` variables 
in the dataset. In this case study, we will select a 
subset of variables. If you are interested, you can 
change the list below to include other variables as 
a future exercise. 

```{r}
rhc_df <- 
  rhc %>% 
    select(age = age,
           sex = sex,
           race = race,
           education = edu,
           income = income,
           med_ins = ninsclas,
           disease = cat1,
           cancer = ca,
           weight = wtkilo1,
           temp = temp1,
           bp = meanbp1,
           resp = resp1,
           hrt = hrt1,
           pf = pafi1,
           ph = ph1,
           death = dth30,
           time = t3d30,
           RHC = swang1)
```

According to the 
[codebook](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html), 
a summary of the variables we are interested
in is given below.

# Exploratory data analysis

Our main interest is to investigate the influence of 
RHC on survival. but first let's use exploratory data 
analysis (EDA) to explore the relationship of RHC 
with other variables in our dataset. 

First, we can stratify the `RHC` column in the `rhc_df` 
dataset into two groups: the ones with and without the 
RHC procedure. Then, we can summarize the potential
confounders within each subgroup to identify if 
there are differences between them. The demographics 
can help us understand the one to one relation between 
right heart catheterization and other variables.


We will use function `CreateTableOne()` in 
[`tableone` package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tableone/versions/0.10.0)
to summarize both continuous and categorical variables 
with respect to the `RHC` column in our dataset. Then,
we can use statistical tests (specifically Chi-square 
and _t_-tests) to investigate relationship between 
`RHC` and either continuous or categorical variables. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
tblprint <- 
  CreateTableOne(data = rhc_df, strata = 'RHC') %>%
  print()

tblprint[c(3, 4, 9, 14, 21, 31, 42, 44),4] <- 'Chi-sq'
tblprint[c(2, 8, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43),4] <- 't-test'
```

`CreateTableOne()` function creates an object summarizing 
all baseline variables optionally stratifying by one or more
startifying variables and performing statistical tests. To 
make this object be easily manipulated, such as changing 
value and being understood by `kable()` function, we use
function `print()` to change its type as dataframe.

```{r}
kable(tblprint , "html", 
      caption = "Stritified by Right Heart Catheterization", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling('responsive') %>%
  add_indent(c(5:7, 10:13,15:20,22:30,32:34))
```


`kable()` function is a very simple table generator and enables you to 
create awesomes tables by playing with its arguments. Here, we use `kable_styling()`
function to modify the style of HTML output, and use `add_indent()` function
to add indentations to row headers. All of this work are aimed to construct
a nice table.

What do you see? Take a moment to reflect on what these differences suggest. 
The unadjusted outcomes indicate that patients managed with RHC were more likely 
to be white male, to have private insurance, to have under $11k income,
to also have an acute kidney injury 
([ARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury)), 
multisystem organ failure ([MOSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome))
or chronic heart failure ([CHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure)).
Patients with RHC were less likely to have cancer. 

Knowing information about how the populations between 
patients that were or were not managed with `RHC` is 
important because we want to identify whether `RHC` has 
an impact on survival and not because there are other 
differences (e.g. whether they have cancer or not) 
in the two populations of patients. We will 
learn in a little bit more about how to overcome these
differences in the population. 

## Data visualization

Next, let's use data visualization to explore the 
relationships between RHC and the other variables in 
our dataset. Here, we will use the `ggplot2` package 
from the `tidyverse`.

First, let's explore the `sex`, `race` and `med_ins` 
variables with respect to the `RHC` column. We will 
show different barplots using the `geom_bar()` function
in `ggplot2`. We also use the `ggarrange` function from the 
[`ggpubr` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/index.html) 
to arrange the subfigures into one plot. 

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
p1 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = sex)) + 
          geom_bar() +
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC')
p2 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = race)) + 
          geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC') + 
          ylab('proportion')

p3 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = med_ins)) + 
          geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC') + 
          ylab('proportion')

ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3, nrow=1)
```

The difference between the left plot and the 
other two plots, is the middle and right plots 
use the command `position='fill'` option in
the `geom_bar()` function. In this case, it 
shows the proportion rather than count making 
the y-axis cover the entire range between 
0 and 1. 

These plots further match our understanding of the 
characteristics of patients: patients managed with 
RHC were more likely to be white males (teal and blue
in left two plots) and to have private insurance 
(blue in right plot). Here we just provide three examples, 
but we encourage you to try more variables that
you are interested in!

Besides these three categorical variables, we also 
pick three continuous variables and visualize them.

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
p4 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = age, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
           ggtitle('distribution of age')
p5 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = bp, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
           ggtitle('distribution of blood pressure') +
            ylab('blood pressure')
p6 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = pf, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
            ggtitle('distribution of PaO2/FiO2') +
              ylab('PaO2/FIO2 ratio')

         
ggarrange(p4, p5,p6, ncol=3, nrow=1)
```

The `age` difference between the RHC and No RHC 
groups seem to be negligible, while blood pressure 
(`bp`) and PaO2/FIO2 ratio (`pf`) differ largely. 
We see that patients who receive RHC tend to have 
lower blood pressure (`bp`) than patients who do not. 
Similarly, patients who receive RHC tend to have 
lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio (`pf`), which indicates that 
blood pressure and PaO2/FIO2 ratio might be related to 
whether or not a patient receives the RHC treatment. 

# Data analysis

Because we want to investigate the impact of receiving 
the `RHC` treatment on a patient's 30-day survival,
we will use a branch of statistics called 
[survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis).
These methods can be used to analyze the expected duration of 
time until one or more events happen, such as death in 
biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. 

## Survival analysis

### Right censoring

Before we talk about survival analysis, we need to talk about a 
type of time to event data in which the value of a measurement 
or observation is only partially known. This is known as 
[censoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)). 
There are various kinds of censoring, but here we will focus 
only on left- and right-censoring. Right censoring is one of the 
most common type of censoring in survival analysis [see @Klein_2006].

<center>
![](doc/censor.jpeg)
</center>

Suppose there are three patients, A, B and C enroll in the study 
at time $t_0$ and the length of this study is $T$. Assume patient
A died at time $t_1$. In this case, we know his exact survival 
time and this patient is not censored. Next, assume 
patient B quitted the study at time $t_2$, before the end of the 
study ($T$). And patient C was alive at the end of the study ($T$). 
In these cases, we treat patient B and patient C as _right censored_ 
because we know the patients were alive at time $t_2$ and $T$ respectively,
but are unknown when death happened afterwards. Therefore, right 
censoring can play an important role here: the real survival times 
will always be equal to or greater than the observed survival time.


### Kaplan-Meier 

In consideration of right censoring, 
[Kaplan-Meier estimator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3059453/) 
can be a good choice to estimate the survival rate. 
It is a non-parametric method used to estimate the 
probability of survival. In general, the survival 
probability is calculated as 
one minus the probablity of death. At each time interval, 
the probability of death equals the number of patients
who died ($d_i$) divided by the number of patients 
at risk of dying ($n_i$). 
Here, the Kaplan-Meier estimator treats those who have 
died, as well as those who withdraws from a study, is 
lost to follow-up, or is alive without event occurrence 
at last follow-up (right-censored), not be 
counted in the denominator. Otherwise it is likely to 
underestimate the probability of death. 


The estimated survival function is written as:

$$\widehat{S(t)}\ =\prod_{i:\ t_i\leq t}(1-\frac{d_i}{n_i}) $$

where $t_i$ is the time when at least one event 
happened. You can think of the method as a series of 
declining horizontal steps which, with a large enough 
sample size, approaches the true survival function for 
that population.

The `Surv()` function in the 
[`survival` package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survival/versions/2.11-4)
uses a specific class from the `survival` package 
to create a specialized object. It takes as input both 
the time to the event (`time`) and whether or not the
event has happened by the end of the study (`death`) 
and then creates an object that describes when right
censoring has occurred. 

Let's look at the `Surv()` function help file

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?Surv
```

We see we need variables for the `time` and `event` 
arguments to create a `Surv` object. In our data frame
we can use the `time` variable for the `time` argument. 
For the `event` argument, we can use the `death` 
variable, which is the response varable in our survival
analysis. 

**Not**: In the help file, for the `event` argument, 
it states that 

> "The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 
1=dead. Other choices are TRUE/FALSE (TRUE = death) or 
1/2 (2=death)."

Let's look at the data type of the `death` column in 
the `rhc_df` data frame. 

```{r}
str(rhc_df$death)
```

We see it is a vector of character strings. So to 
create a `Surv` object, we need to convert the datatype of
the column to a numeric. To do this we will use the 
`mutate()` function in 
[`dplyr` package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8)
to transform the factor as numerical variable. 
While we here, we will also change the data 
type of `RHC` to be encoded as a 0 for "No RHC" and a 1 for 
"RHC" 

```{r}
rhc_df <- rhc_df %>% 
  mutate(death = if_else(death == "No", 0, 1), 
         RHC = if_else(RHC == "No RHC", 0, 1))
```

Let's check on what the datatypes are now. 

```{r}
str(rhc_df$death)
str(rhc_df$RHC)
```

Now we are ready to run the `Surv()` function. 

```{r}
sur_obj <- Surv(rhc_df$time, rhc_df$death) 
sur_obj[1:10]
```

Do you see `+` behind survival times? This is an example of what 
we discussed before - right censored data points. `30+` indicates 
this patient survived until the end of the study while the `2`
means this patient died at the second day after study began. 

Also, the `sur_obj` object can be interpreted by the 
`survfit()` function from the `survival` package 
(see below) which is used to compute an estimate of a 
survival curve for censored data.
In addition to `sur_obj` object that we created, the
`survfit()` function also includes as input the response 
variable of interest in a simple case of right-censored data. 
Here that is the `RHC` variable. 

```{r}
fit <- survfit(sur_obj ~ RHC, data = rhc_df)
fit
```

The total number of the patients managed by RHC is 
`r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)`, and 
`r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)-fit$n.censor[58]` of them
died within 30 days (or a proportion of 
`r round(1-(fit$n.censor[58]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)),2)`). 
The total number of the patients not having RHC is 
`r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE)`, and 
`r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE) - fit$n.censor[29]` of them 
died in 30 days (or a proportion of `r round(1-(fit$n.censor[29]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE)),2)`).

To show the survival curve, the `autoplot()` function 
from the `ggplot2` package can be used to create a Kaplan-Meier curve
for `survfit` objects. We can also use this to show the survival rate 
stratified by whether or not a patient was managed with `RHC`. 

**Note**: Here we are not adjusting for any other covariates, 
and we are only considering the `RHC` variable. In the sections below, 
we will discuss how to adjust for other covariates. 

```{r}
p_km <- ggsurvplot(fit, ylim = c(0.6, 1),
      legend.title = "RHC",
      legend.labs = c("0", "1"),
       ylab = 'survival probability', 
       xlab = 'survival time', 
       title = 'Kaplan-Meier Plot',
       ggtheme = theme_minimal())

p_km
```

The x-axis is the survival time, and the y-axis is 
the survival probability. The small vertical 
tick-marks indicate individual patients whose survival 
times have been right-censored. It looks like a
step function since the probability changes each 
day (the event data are recorded daily). When no 
truncation or censoring occurs, the Kaplan-Meier curve 
is the complement of the empirical distribution function.

Some of the description of the plot: at the beginning, 
all the patients are alive. The survival probability at 
the end of 30 days of a patient having a right catheterization 
is `r round(fit$n.censor[58]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE))` 
and `r round(fit$n.censor[29]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE))` 
for patients not having the right catheterization. 

We see from the Kaplan-Meier plot and that
patients with RHC treatment have a lower survival rate. 
But, think back to the 'Data visualization' section. 
We also saw a difference in the distribution for covariates 
such as blood pressure. This suggests that patients who are or are not 
managed by RHC might be different populations of patients driven 
by other covariates. Therefore, the difference in observed 
survival rates might be driven by differences in 
the other covariates. Our goal is to determine whether RHC 
has an impact on survival, but we want to make a fair 
comparison between the patients managed with and without RHC. 
Therefore, we are curious if there is still a difference in 
survival after adjusting for potential confounders with the 
other variables. To do this, we will introduce propensity scores and 
propensity score matching in the next few sections as a way to do this. 


## Propensity score matching

As we mentioned above, it is a popular belief that
it is beneficial for patients to be managed by RHC [see @Connors_1996]. 
Therefore, a RCT is not possible. The Connors et al. paper
explains this phenomenon like this: 

> "In observational studies, the treatment selection has connection 
with patients characteristics but also has a link with the outcomes. 
For example, patients with lower blood pressure are more likely to get RHC, 
and they are also more likely to die. The effect of such treatment selection bias 
has been called "confounding by indication". 

In the next section, we will introduce propensity scores 
as a way to adjust for treatment selection bias. 

### Propensity score

Propensity score is defined as the probability of receving treatment 
with consideration of the complete information about this patient. 
Information may include `age`, `gender` and `blood pressure` etc. 
To estimate the propensity score, these information are treated as 
explanatory variables in a logistic regression model while the 
response variable is a binary variable indicating whether or not 
this patient receive treatment (`RHC`).


### Propensity score matching

To adjust for treatment selection bias, the variables that
independently affect the decision to use or withhold the treatment 
must be identified and measured. Here we will accomplish that
with what's called 
[propensity score matching (PSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching). 

In a statistical analysis with observational data, PSM is 
a matching technique that attempts to estimate the effect of a
treatment, policy, or other intervention by modeling covariates
that predict receiving, for example the treatment. PSM attempts 
to reduce the bias due to the confounding variables by ensuring
that outcomes among units that received the treatment are 
compared fairly to outcomes that did not receive the treatment. 
When we say "fairly", we mean that the outcomes have similar 
probabilities of receiving the treatment. 

In general, the procedures of PSM include:

* Run logistic regression:
    + Dependent variable: Y = 1, if with RHC; Y = 0, otherwise.
    + Choose appropriate confounders and apply multivariate logistic regression.
    + Obtain propensity score, which is the predicted probability (p). A higher score indicates a higher probability of receiving the treatment.

* One-to-one matching on propensity score:
    + Randomly select one patient with RHC.
    + Match this patient who has the closest propensity score in all patients without RHC. The difference should less than a certain threshold. (we will discuss the threshold later)
    + Continue this matching until all possible pairs were identified.
    
Let's use a plot to explain how the matching works. 

<center>
![](doc/psm.png)
</center>

Each dot represents a patient in the observational study along the
corresponding line segment (a propensity to receive the treatment 
ranging from 0 to 1). The position reflects the propensity score. 
On the right side, the large propensity score reflects a high probability 
of receiving the treatment and vice versa for the left side.
In the cartoon, there are 5 patients who receive the RHC treatment (teal) 
and 5 patients without RHC treatment (red). Using the covariates in a 
logistic regression model, we estimate the propensity score. Then,
we match patients based on propensity score across the two groups. 
The closer their propensity score is,the more likely they will be 
matched as a pair. 

Here, there are 3 pairs in the middle: A1 and B1, A2 and B2, A3 
and B3, as these are the closest matching pairs. However, there are 
2 samples on the left part in No RHC group 
and 2 samples on the right part in RHC group that do not have patients 
to match with across the two groups (separated by dashed line). 
This is because there isn't any sample whose propensity score are close to them. 
In this case, they fail to be matched and will be removed from downstream
analyses. After the matching is complete, we have 3 pairs of patients that 
are matched successfully (or 3 samples with RHC treatment and 3 samples 
without RHC treatment).

### Estimate propensity scores

As we mentioned above, propensity score is calculated by logistic regression
in which the treatment assignment is the dependent variable. The
`glm()` function in the 
[`stats` package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/00Index.html) 
is widely used to estimate generalized linear models. 
The argument `family =` provides a convenient way to specify the 
details of the models used. Here, since the outcomes
is binary and we would like to fit a logistic regression model, 
we set `binomial(link = "logit")`.

We exclude `time` and `death` here because these two variables have no 
relationship with treatment assignment (`RHC`) and only relate 
to the survival analysis that we will perform later on. 

```{r}
psm_glm <- glm(RHC ~ . - time - death, 
               family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
               data = rhc_df)
```

Using this model, we can calculate the propensity score
for each patient. It is simply the patient's predicted probability 
of receiving a RHC, given the estimated coefficients from the 
logit model. To do this, we will use the `predict()` function
and create a data frame that has the propensity score 
as well as the patient's actual treatment status.

```{r}
glm_df <- data.frame(p_rhc <-  predict(psm_glm, 
                                       type = "response"),
                     p_norhc <-  1 - p_rhc,
                     RHC <-  psm_glm$model$RHC)
```

Inside the data frame, the `p_rhc` is the predicted probability of 
being assigned to RHC, while `p_norhc` is the predicted probability of 
being assigned to no RHC.

After estimating the propensity score, we can plot the propensity
scores by treatment status using histograms. 

```{r}
glm_df %>%
  mutate(RHC = ifelse(RHC == 1, "RHC", "No RHC")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = p_rhc,fill = RHC, color = RHC)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, position = 'identity')+
  xlab("Probability of receiving RHC before matching") +
  ylab("density") + theme_bw()
```

Note that, you can change the `position` adjustment to use for 
overlapping points on the layer (default value is `position ='stack'`).
In contrast, the `position = 'identity'` argument will place each 
object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. 
Finally, to see that overlapping we need to make the bars slightly 
transparent by setting `alpha` to a small value. 

We can clearly see the distribution of propensity scores is not 
balanced across the two groups, that's why we will move to the 
next step: one-to-one matching.


### One-to-one matching on propensity score

The `matchit()` function is the main command of the package 
[`MatchIt`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/MatchIt.pdf), 
which uses parametric models for causal inference to select well-matched
subsets of the original treated and control groups.

The arguments provided by the `matchit()` function are given below:

* `formula`: Specifies the logistic regression formula you would like to use. 
Here, we just use `psm_glm` that we created in last section.

* `data`: Data frame (or database table name) containing the variables for analysis in the formula arguments.

* `method =`: Specifies the matching methods. Options include:
    + `exact`: Matches each treated unit with a control unit that 
    has exactly the same values on each covariate. It is useless when there are too many variables.
    + `subclass`: Breaks the data set into subclasses so the distributions of 
    the covariates are similar in each subclass.
    + `nearest`: Matches a pair that is closest in terms of a distance measure (This is the default method).
    + `optimal`: Minimize the average absolute distance across all matched pairs.
 
* `caliper`: For the nearest neighbor matching, this has a further restriction that 
the absolute difference in the propensity scores of matched subjects must be below 
some prespecified threshold (the `caliper` distance). [see @Austin_2011] suggested 
using a caliper size of one-fifth of a standard deviation of the sample estimated 
propensity scores.

* `ratio`: Indicates the ratio of treatment cases to control cases to match. 
Default is one-to-one matching. You can increase the number of control cases matched to
each treatment case by increasing this number; usually this number is between 1 and 5.

If we dig into [see @Austin_2011], we will find that to 
specify the value of `caliper` (or the threshold), the 
standard deviation of the logit odds of estimated propensity 
scores is necessary. That is what we calculated in previous 
section. We see that the `p_rhc` will be useful now!

First let's calculate our threshold that we will use in `caliper`. 

```{r}
epsilon <- 0.2*sd(log(p_rhc/(1-p_rhc)))
```

Then, we can run the `matchit()` function!

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
psm_mod <- matchit(RHC ~ age + sex + race + education +
                     income + med_ins + disease + cancer +
                     weight + temp + bp + resp + hrt + pf +
                     ph, data = rhc_df, method = "nearest", 
                   caliper  = epsilon, ratio = 1)

rhc_psm_df <- match.data(psm_mod)
colnames(rhc_psm_df)
```

Using `match.data()` function, we can get the final 
dataset with matched patients (`rhc_psm_df`). Note that 
the final dataset is smaller than the original: it contains 
`r dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` observations, meaning that 
`r 0.5*dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` pairs of treated and control 
observations were matched. It also contains a variable 
called `distance`, which is the propensity score.  

Let's check out what the distribution of propensity scores 
look like in our matched dataset: 

```{r}
rhc_psm_df %>%
  mutate(RHC = ifelse(RHC == 1, "RHC", "No RHC")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance,fill = RHC, color = RHC)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = 'identity') +
  xlab("Probability of receiving RHC after matching") +
  ylab('density') + theme_bw()

```

Now the distribution of propensity scores are much
more balanced! In addition to using `ggplot2`, there 
is another way to implement the result using the 
[`plot()` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MatchIt/versions/1.0-2/topics/plot.matchit)
inside the `MatchIt` package.

```{r}
plot(psm_mod,type = "hist" )
```

Just putting the `psm_mod` object in `plot()` 
can offer you a nice plot, showing the distributions
of propensity scores before and after matching. The 
histograms before matching on on the left,
and the histograms after matching on the right. 


## Cox Proportional Hazard Model

Given balanced data, let's continue to investigate the 
effect of `RHC` on the probability of survival 
for the patients who were treated and not treated 
with `RHC`. 

In Kaplan-Meier plot, we created the `sur_obj` object 
with the time that passes (`time`), and the event that 
occurs (`death`) to plot the survival curve. This 
non-parametric method is a simple comparision which 
can be used to get a first-step understanding based on 
single covariates (e.g. `RHC`). More often than not,
we want to estimate survival probablities taking 
into account additional characteristics that may
influence the outcome, such as `blood pressure`, 
`age`. In our case, we are interested in the effect 
of `RHC`, but we also know there are additional 
covariates that also might effect the outcome. So, we 
would like to adjust for this additional covariates. 

This is where we will introduce the
[Cox proportional hazards model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model)
(Cox PH model), 
which essentially is a regression model to investigate
the association between the survival time of patients 
and one or more predictor variables. While the 
Kaplan-Meier curve is an example of a _univariate_ 
analysis (only describing the survival with respect to 
one covariate), the Cox PH model can be a _multivariate_
model that simultaneously assesses the effect of 
multiple covariates on survival time. 


### Basics of the Cox PH model

The Cox PH model is expressed using the hazard function
$h(t)$ at time $t$. The intepretation of the hazard 
function is the risk of dying at time $t$. 

To get a sense of what is the hazard function, let's consider the 
survival function. If $T$ is a continous random variable 
with probability distribution $f(t)$ and cumulative 
distribution $F(t)$ that represents the survival time, 
we can describe the cumulative distribution function as

$$F(t) = Pr(T < t)$$

The complement of the cumulative distribution is 
survival function $S(t)$

$$S(t) \equiv Pr(T \geq t) = \int_{t}^{\infty} f(t) dt$$

where $f(t)$ is the probability density function
at time $t$. 

Now, as mentioned above, the hazard function is 
risk of dying at time $t$. Another way of phrasing 
this is the patient was given the patient was alive
at time $t$, what's the conditional probability of 
dying in the next time interval of length  $\Delta t$, 
or that the event will occurr in the interval 
$[t,  t+ \Delta t)$.

$$ h(t) =\displaystyle{\lim_{\Delta t \to 0}} 
\frac{ P(t \leq T <t+\Delta t|T \ge t)}{\Delta t} 
= \frac{ P(t \leq T <t+\Delta t)}{P(T \ge t) \Delta t} 
= \frac{ f(t) \Delta t}{S(t) \Delta t} $$

which can be written as the joint probability of the event 
occuring in the interval $[t,  t+ \Delta t)$ and $T \ge t$ 
(which is the same as the event occuring in the interval 
$[t,  t+ \Delta t)$), divided by the probability of $T \ge t$. 
The numerator is just $f(t) \Delta t$ for small $\Delta t$ and 
denominator is just $S(t)$. 

If we divide by $\Delta t$ and take the limit as 
$\Delta t \to 0$, then the hazard function is just 

$$h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$

Neat! OK now we are ready to get back to the Cox PH
model. As a reminder, we noted that the Cox PH model 
is expressed using the hazard function $h(t)$ 
at time $t$. For the $i^{th}$ observation and a given
set of covariates 
$\mathbf{X}_i = \{ X_{i1}, \ldots X_{ip} \}$, 
the Cox PH model has the form 

$$h(t | \mathbf{X}_i)= h_0(t)  \exp(\beta_1 X_{i1} + \ldots \beta_p X_{ip}) 
= h_0(t) \exp(\beta \mathbf{X}_{i}) $$

where the coefficients $\beta = \{\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p \}$
are the effect sizes of the covariates $\mathbf{X}_i$. 
The quantities $\exp{\beta_j}$ are called hazard ratios (HR). 
If $\beta_j > 0$ (or $\exp{\beta_j}$ > 1), this implies as 
$X_{ij}$ increases, the hazard increases and thus the 
survival probability decreases. In constrast, if the HR is 
less than 1, then this is a reduction in the hazard (or 
and increase in survival). 

**Note**: If you take the log of the hazard function, this
becomes a linear model with a baseline hazard function 
that varies over time. However, another link function is the 
"complementary log-log" model (or $log(-log(1-h(t)))$), 
which is useful when the probability of an event is very 
small or very large. 

Finally, $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard at time $t$. 
This is hazard if all the $\mathbf{x}_i$ are 0. A 
**key assumption** of the Cox PH model is 
that the baseline hazard curves for groups of observations 
should be proportional and cannot cross.

Let's explore what we mean by this. Consider the $i^{th}$ and
$j^{th}$ observation with only one covariate $X_1$, but the 
observed value differs between the $i^{th}$ and
$j^{th}$ observation. The ratio of their hazard functions is

$$ \frac{h_i(t|X_{1}  = x)}{h_j(t|X_{1} = x^{'})}=\frac{h_0(t) e^{\beta x}}{h_0(t) e^{\beta x^{'}}}=e^{\beta (x-x^{'})}$$


which is independent with respect to time. Another way of 
phrasing this is that the hazard of the event in any group
is a constant multiple of the hazard in any other group. 

This assumption should always be checked when using the
Cox PH model (we give an example of this below). 


### Model Application

Now, we can fit a Cox PH model using the `coxph()` function, 
from the `survival` package. Similiar to the estimating a 
Kaplan-Meier curve, we first create a survival object 
using the `Surv()` function (e.g. `Surv(time, death)`). 

In the next section, we will fit a few univariate Cox 
PH models and then we will fit a multivariate Cox PH 
model using all the covariates in our dataset (`rhc_psm_df`) 
afterwards. We note that both of these models are using
the data after adjusting for propensity scores.

#### Univariate Cox PH model

To apply univariate Cox PH models, we will include
only one variable in the Cox PH model. Here we select 
the `RHC`, `age` and `weight` variables as examples, 
and show the results.

A univariate Cox PH model for `RHC` is given by 

```{r}
fit_uni1 <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ RHC, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)
```

We can also use the `tidy()` function in the 
[`broom`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/index.html)
package to create a `tidy` representation of the 
model output. We just show the head of it here, but 
you are encouraged to research more if you are 
interested in it!

```{r}
res <- tidy(fit_uni1, conf.int = TRUE,
                conf.level = 0.95)
res
```

Next, a univariate Cox PH model for `age` is given by 

```{r}
fit_uni2 <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ age, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)

res <- tidy(fit_uni2, conf.int = TRUE,
                conf.level = 0.95)
res
```

Finally, a univariate Cox PH model for `weight` is given by 

```{r}
fit_uni3 <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ weight, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)

res <- tidy(fit_uni3, conf.int = TRUE, 
                conf.level = 0.95)
res
```

Looking at the results, we see that `RHC` and `age` 
are associated with survival, while `weight`
does not have a statistically significant effect. 

#### Multivariate Cox PH model

Next, we will fit a Cox PH model using the `coxph()` 
function using all the covariates in our dataset 
(`rhc_psm_df`) after propensity score estimation. 

Now, if we recall the column names in our dataset, 

```{r}
colnames(rhc_psm_df)
```

To incorproate all the variables in the model, we can 
use the `~ .` R model formula syntax, but we need to 
suse the negative (`-`) syntax to exclude some variables. 
We see the propensity socre (`distance`) and weights 
(`weights`) that were calcuated by `matchit()` are 
included, which we do not need in model fitting. We 
also do not want to include the covariates `time` 
or `death` as these covariates are used in the `sur_obj`
object to note right censored observations. 

```{r}
fit_all <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ . - time - death -
              distance - weights, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)

res <- tidy(fit_all, conf.int = TRUE,
                conf.level = 0.95)
head(res)
```

Recall, the coefficients here (`estimates`) are the 
$\beta_j$ coefficients. We can convert this to hazard ratios 
by exponentiating the coefficients. If the exponentiated 
coefficient is larger than 1, the variable will increase 
the hazard of the event occuring (or decrease the 
survival probability). 

Note, we can also ask to report the coefficients 
(`estimate`) and confidence intervals on an 
exponential scale with the `exponentiate = TRUE`
argument. 

```{r}
res_exp <- tidy(fit_all, exponentiate = TRUE, 
            conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
head(res_exp)
tail(res_exp)
```


### Check assumption

Now that we have fit our Cox PH model, let's check 
the assumptions of the Cox PH model in our data. 
If you recall, the **fundamental assumption** of the 
Cox PH model is that the model assumes the hazard is
constant with the time. For instance, in our case we 
want to evaluate the relationship of patients being 
managed with the RHC treatment on the hazard of death, 
controlling for possible confounding variables which might
be related to death. But what if some variables' values 
change over time?

#### Complementary log-log plot

One way to do this is to use data visualizations to check 
the assumption. A plot that shows a non-random pattern 
against time is a violation of the assumption. 

The first plot we will consider is the "complementary 
log-log" model ($log(-log(1-h(t)))$ or $log(-log(S(t)))$ 
vs. $ln(t)$. For a given variable (e.g. `RHC`), here is
a cartoon of what it looks like if the assumption is 
not violated:

</center>

And here is a cartoon of what it would look like if the 
assumption was violated: 

<center>
![](doc/check-violate.png)
</center>

Here we see that the survival curves cross, clearly 
indicating a violation of the proportional hazards assumption. 

Now let's look at it in our data: 

```{r}
sur_obj2 <- Surv(rhc_psm_df$time, rhc_psm_df$death)

ggsurvplot(survfit(sur_obj2 ~ RHC, data = rhc_psm_df),
           fun = function(x){log(-log(x))})
```

Our dataset doesn't violate the assumption.


#### Statistical assessments 

Another approach is to use a formal statistical test to 
asesses the proportional hazards assumption. Here we will 
use the `cox.zph()` function in `survival` package. It tests
for proportionality of all the variables specified in the model 
by creating interactions terms with time (on the log scale). 
Then, the function will test for independence for each 
variable. It also performs a global test for all the 
interactions tested together in the model. If the _p_-value 
is less than 0.05, this suggests a violation of the PH
assumption. [see @Grambsch_1994]

For instance, if our model is 
$log~h(t|X_1)= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$ (where 
$\beta_0 = \log(h_0(t))$), to test whether $X_1$ is 
time-varying, the `cox.zph()` function creates an 
interaction term $X_1*log~t$ in the model. 
Now the model is 

$$log~h(t|X_1)= \beta_0 + \beta_1~X_1 + \beta_1^{'}(X_1*log~t)$$

Using a null hypothesis of $H_0: \beta_1^{'}=0$, we can 
assess whether or not there is a relationship with time by 
if we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Note, 
a _p_-value less than a specified Type 1 error (e.g. $\alpha$ 
= 0.05) suggests there is evidence that the variable ($X_1$) is 
time-varying.

To illustrate the test, we use our data set as an example,
we use the `fit_all` Cox PH model from above. The `transform`
argument describes how the survival times should be
transformed before the test is performed. For example, we 
use `transform = log` to get $X*log~t$ in our model. 

```{r}
check.ph <- cox.zph(fit_all, transform = 'log')
check.ph 

```

The first column (`rho`) gives the Pearson product-moment 
correlation between the scaled [Schoenfeld residuals](https://www.mbaskool.com/business-concepts/statistics/8766-schoenfeld-residuals-test.html) 
and `log(time)` for each covariate, which is the difference 
between the covariate for that subject and the weighted average 
of covariates in the risk set. The last row contains
the global test for all the interactions tested at once. 

We notice the _p_-value for `ph` is less than 0.05, 
suggesting that there may be a violation of the Cox PH
assumptions for this variable. If you recall, this variable
represents the PH level from the patient. 

Let's explore this a bit more with a graphical assessment of 
the Schoenfeld residuals. Here we pick out 6 variables (`age`, 
`sex`,  `education`, `diseaseComa`, `diseaseCOPD` and `ph`)
including the `ph` variable and graphically assessess 
whether or not there is a relationship with time. 
We will use the function `ggcoxzph` in package 
[`survminer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survminer/index.html), 
which will generate plots of residuals for individual 
predictors and a non-zero slope is an evidence against
the Cox PH assumption. 

```{r,fig.width=9, fig.height=8}
#get graphical diagnostic for `age`, `sex`, `education`, `diseaseComa`, `diseaseCOPD` and `ph`
plist <- ggcoxzph(check.ph, point.alpha = 0.1)[c(1,2,5,17,18,30)]
#plot them in one chunk
grid.arrange(grobs = lapply(plist, ggplotGrob), ncol =2)
```

The `grid.arrange()` function in package `gridExtra` can be  
used to arrange several plots in one chunk. The `ggcoxzph` 
function returns an object which is a list of ggplot objects, 
rather than plot a `grob`, or more specifically, gtables. 
`gtables` are matrix-like layouts placed in cells that can
be directly used as an input in `grid` system and related packages.
So to convert them, we use `ggplotGrob()` function in package 
`ggplot2` to generate ggplot2 plot grobs that are compatible
with function `grid.arrange()`.

In the figures above, the solid line is a smoothing spline
fit to the plot, with the dashed lines representing confidence
interval. As we said, an apparent departure from a horizontal 
line indicates violation for assumption. All of these 6 
variables have a zero slope, suggesting the assumption is 
not violated. For more information on graphical diagnostics, 
we refer the reader to [@Klein_2006]:

> "We prefer graphical checks to formal goodness-of-fit test because 
we believe that the proportional hazards assumption only approximates
the correct model for a covariate and any formal test, based on
a large enough sample, will reject the null hypothesis of proportionality."

Therefore, even though we see a _p_-value less than 0.05 for 
the `ph` variable, we do not see a strong relationship with time. 
One way this can happen is if we are testing a model with many 
variables, the _p_-values from some variables may be less 
than 0.05 by chance. Especially when there are lots of 
variables, a subtle deviance will be reflected on p-value. 


### Comparing estimates of survival 

Now let's assess whether or not `RHC` has an effect on 
the overall survival, given that we have now adjusted 
for potential confounders using a Cox PH model 
and selected a balanced population of patients using 
propensity score matching. 

If you recall, the univariate Cox PH model that we fit
showed a strong effect of `RHC` on survival: 

```{r}
fit_uni1 <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ RHC, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)

res_uni1 <- tidy(fit_uni1, exponentiate = TRUE,
            conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
res_uni1
```

For multivariate case, the result is shown below.
We are only interested in 'RHC' so we extract its
result:

```{r}
fit_all <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ . - 
                   time - death -
                   distance - weights, 
                 data = rhc_psm_df)

res_all <- tidy(fit_all,exponentiate = TRUE,
            conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)

res_all[31, ]
# row contains result for RHC
```

Then we would like to summarise them in a table:
```{r}
df_res <- data.frame(c1 = c("RHC", "RHC"),
                     c2 = c("univariate Cox PH", "multivariate Cox PH"),
                     c3 = c(res_uni1$estimate, res_all[31,]$estimate),
                     c4 = c(res_uni1$p.value, res_all[31,]$p.value),
                     c5 = c("None","Variables in `rhc_psm_df`")) 
colnames(df_res) <- c("Prognostic variable","Method ", "HR",
                      "p-value", "Adjusted for")

df_res %>%
  kable(caption = "Prognostic result for RHC") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

The results for these two model don't vary too much.

Also, we can add survival plots with the curves split 
by `RHC` with the help of `ggadjustedcurves()` function in 
`survminer` package. 

If we compare that to the survival plot after adjusting for 
other covariates, we see that: 

```{r,fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
# Univariate case
p_uni1 <- ggadjustedcurves(fit_uni1, data = rhc_psm_df,
      variable = "RHC",
      ylim = c(0.6, 1), legend = "top",
      legend.title = "RHC",
       ylab = 'survival probability', 
       xlab = 'survival time', 
       title = 'Cox PH (univariate)',
       ggtheme = theme_minimal())

# Multivariate case
p_all <- ggadjustedcurves(fit_all, data = rhc_psm_df,
      variable = "RHC",
      ylim = c(0.6, 1), legend = "top",
      legend.title = "RHC",
      ylab = 'survival probability', 
      xlab = 'survival time', 
      title = 'Cox PH (multivariate)',
      ggtheme = theme_minimal())

grid.arrange( p_km$plot, p_uni1, p_all, ncol = 3)
```

You might ask why did we put `p_km$plot` in 
`grid.arrange()` function? Similiar to the question 
before, `p_km` is a list created by function
`ggsurvplot()` and it is not compatible with 
`grid.arrange()`. However, a function called 
`arrange_ggsurvplots()` can be used to arrange
multiple `ggsurvplot`s. 

But the other two plots are created by 
`ggadjustedcurves()` that are compatible with 
`grid.arrange()`. There is an easy way to solve it: 
extract `plot` object from list `p_km`.

The middle and right plots show survival curves
for matched dataset, corresponding to univariate 
or multivariate model respectively. In multivariate 
case, the difference of survival rate seems to be smaller 
than that in univariate case, but it is subtle.

Compared with the Kaplan-Meier plot (left), whether 
we use univariate or multivariate model, the 
difference of survival rate between these two 
groups tenuates; But patients in `RHC` group still
have lower survival rate than `No RHC` group. 


# Summary

In this case study, we mainly revealed the association between time to death 
in 30 days and RHC based on an observational dataset. We covered various fields 
to deal with this situation, such as survival analysis, propensity score matching and
Cox proportional hazards model. In conclusion, RHC has a positive relationship with 
risk of mortality even though we applied adjustment. 

At first we separated the dataset in two groups, No RHC group and RHC group, 
based on the variable `RHC`. We gave a table to show the distribution of all variables
in two groups and visualize the difference. We found some of them have large difference, 
such as blood pressure and PaO2/FIO2 ratio, while others do not vary too much, like age.


Then we tried Kaplan-Meier method, a non-parametric method, to find 
the relationship of survival rate and whether a patient receive RHC treatment or not. 
The result was shown as a survival curve plot. It provided us an initial understanding 
that survival rate is higher in population managed without RHC treatment. 

But, since it is an observational dataset, the bias in treatment selection 
is an unavoidable problem, resulting in lower accuracy. To solve it, we made use of 
a causal inference method: propensity score matching. Logistic regression was 
applied to determine the probability of receiving RHC (propensity score). 
It represented the relationship between multiple covariates and the use of RHC 
and was used as a criteria to match. We matched observations based on propensity score 
and finally kept `r 0.5*dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` pairs. As expected, the outcomes was pretty successful
considering a much more balanced distribution of propensity score in two groups.

In the next step, we further improved our survival analysis model
by using a parametric method: Cox proportional hazards model.
All necessary variables were included, avoiding that we may ignore potential risks. 
We also evaluated the proportionality assumption with graphical checks. There is no
obvious pattern with time so the assumption is supported with our data set. 

Furthermore, we adjusted outcomes and found the difference of survival between two groups tenuates, 
proving the necessity of what we did; However, survival rate for patients with RHC treatment 
are still lower than  patients without RHC treatment so we concluded this treatment is harmful.


There exists much more space for further improvement such as variable selection 
and model engineering. Original data set include `r nrow(rhc)` variabels but we just used 
`r nrow(rhc_psm_df)` variables. Undoubtedly more influential variables provide more information,
drawing in more accurate result. You are encouraged to construct a more complex model with 
further variable and model engineering.

Our outcomes seem to be opposite to the widespread belief that RHC is 
recommended in broad clinical application. This may be caused by the confounding variables 
which increase the probability of receiving RHC and the probability of death overall. 
We admit the limitation of this study and would like to receive more suggestion to 
better understand the role of RHC.
