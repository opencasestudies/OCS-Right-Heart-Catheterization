# Motivation

[Right heart catheterization (RHC)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/cardiovascular/right_heart_catheterization_135,40), also known as pulmonary artery 
catheterization, is an invasive test that mainly checks 
the working state of the heart by guiding a pulmonary
artery (PA) catheter (a small and hollow tube) through 
the pulmonary artery and into the right chambers of the
heart. Here is the video which enables you to understand
how it works.

It is often the case that a foreign object enters the human body, there is the risk of infection. RHC is no different. When the tube is put into the artery and a dye is injected into the heart, potential complications are the rupture of pulmonary artery, arrythmias of the heart where the heart may skip a beat. However, the widespread belief that is it beneficial and safe makes it difficult to design a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 

Without RCTs of RHCs, the only way to evaluate its effectiveness is observational study. The motivation of this case study is to investigate whether or not there is an impact on survival (time to death) due to the use RHC or in an observational dataset. Our main predictor of interest is RHC, but we also want to adjust for all other potential confounders in the dataset. We want to know whether RHC actually improves the patients' survival rate in 30 days adjusted by other baseline variables.


The libraries used in this study are listed in the following table, 
along with their purpose in this particular case study:

# What is the data?

The data are available as a `.csv` at this [link](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.csv): The dataset pertains to day 1 of hospitalization, i.e., the treatment variable `swang1` is whether or not a patient received an RHC (also called the Swan-Ganz catheter) on the first day in which the patient qualified for the study. The description of all variables can be found [here](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html).


# Data Import

As the data are avaiable online, we will import data from the web directly with `read_csv()` function from the [`readr` package]() as part of the `tidyverse`. This dataset was originally used in Connors et al. JAMA 1996;276:889-897, and has been made publicly available.

```{r}
file <- "http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.csv"
rhc <- read_csv(file)
```

Let's take a quick look at the data: 

```{r}
rhc[1:5, 1:5]
```


# Data Wrangling

## Variable selection

There are in total `r ncol(rhc)` variables and `r nrow(rhc)` observations in the dataset. Here, we will only select a subset of variables. If you are interested, you can change the list below to include other variables as a future exercise. 

```{r}
rhc_df <- 
  rhc %>% 
    select(age = age,
           sex = sex,
           race = race,
           education = edu,
           income = income,
           med_ins = ninsclas,
           disease = cat1,
           cancer = ca,
           weight = wtkilo1,
           temp = temp1,
           bp = meanbp1,
           resp = resp1,
           hrt = hrt1,
           pf = pafi1,
           pc = paco21,
           ph = ph1,
           death = dth30,
           time = t3d30,
           RHC = swang1)
```

According to the [codebook](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/rhc.html), a summary of the variables we are interested in is given below.

# Exploratory data analysis

Our main topic is to investigate the influence of RHC.
For the purpose of exploratory data analysis (EDA), let's 
stratify the `RHC` column in the `rhc_df` dataset into two
groups: the ones with and without the RHC procedure. Then, 
we can summarize the potential confounders within each subgroup 
to identify if there are differences between them. The demographics can help us understand the one to one relation between right heart catheterization and other variables.

We will use function `CreateTableOne()` in package [`tableone`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tableone/versions/0.10.0) to summarize both continuous and categorical variables with respect to the `RHC` column in our dataset. 
Then, we can use statistical tests to investigate relationships. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
tblprint <- 
  CreateTableOne(data = rhc_df, strata = 'RHC') %>%
  print()

tblprint[c(3, 4, 9, 14, 21, 31, 43, 45),4] <- 'Chi-sq'
tblprint[c(1, 2),4] <- 't-test'
tblprint <- 
  tblprint %>% print()
```

```{r}
kable(tblprint , "html", 
      caption = "Stritified by Right Heart Catheterization", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling('responsive') %>%
  add_indent(c(5:7, 10:13,15:20,22:30,32:34))
```

What do you see? Take a moment to reflect on what these differences suggest. The unadjusted outcomes indicate that patients managed with RHC were more likely to be white male, to have private insurance, to have under $11k income, to also have an acute kidney injury  ([ARF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_injury)),  [MOSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome) or [CHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure), which are acute kidney injury, multisystem organ failure and chronic heart failure respectively. Patients with RHC were less likely to have cancer. 

## Data visualization

Next, let's use data visualization to explore the relationships between RHC and the other variables in our dataset. Here, we will use the `ggplot2` package from the `tidyverse`.

First, let's explore the `sex`, `race` and `med_ins` variables with respect to the `RHC` column. We will show different barplots using the `geom_bar()` function in `ggplot2`. We also use the `ggarrange` function from the `ggpubr` package to arrange the subfigures into one plot. 

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
p1 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = sex)) + 
          geom_bar() +
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC')
p2 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = race)) + 
          geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC') + 
          ylab('proportion')

p3 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, fill = med_ins)) + 
          geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
           ggtitle('distribution of RHC') + 
          ylab('proportion')

ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3, nrow=1)
```
The dfifference between the left plot and the other two plots, is the middle and right plots use the command `position='fill'` option in the `geom_bar()` function. In this case, it shows the proportion rather than count. 

These plots further match our understanding of the characteristics of patients: patients managed with RHC were more likely to be white male (mostly teal), to have private insurance (mostly blue). Here we just provide three examples, but we encourage you to try more variables that you are interested in!

Besides three categorical variables, we also choose three continuous variables and visualize them.

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=5}
p4 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = age, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
           ggtitle('distribution of age')
p5 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = bp, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
           ggtitle('distribution of blood pressure') +
            ylab('blood pressure')
p6 <- rhc_df %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = RHC, y = pf, fill = RHC)) + 
          geom_boxplot() + 
            ggtitle('distribution of PaO2/FiO2') +
              ylab('PaO2/FIO2 ratio')

         
ggarrange(p4, p5,p6, ncol=3, nrow=1)
```

The age difference between the RHC and No RHC groups seem to be negligible, while blood pressure and PaO2/FIO2 ratio differ largely. We see that patients who receive RHC tend to have lower blood pressure than patients who are not. Similarly, patients who receive RHC tend to have lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, which indicates that blood pressure and PaO2/FIO2 ratio might be related to whether or not a patient receives the RHC treatment. 


# Data analysis

Because we want to investigate the impact of receiving the RHC treatment on a patient's 30 day survival, we will use a branch of statistics called [survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis). This can be used to analyze the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. 

## Survival analysis

### Outcome and time variables

Before we dive into the methods for survival analysis, we need to changie the datatype of the `death` and `RHC` columns in the `rhc_df` dataframe. Let's check out their datatype. 

```{r}
str(rhc_df$death)
str(rhc_df$RHC)
```

We see they are character strings. We want to convert the datatype of these 
columns to a numeric. To do this we will use the `as.factor()` and `as.numeric()` functions to 
transform the factor as numerical variable. In our case, after these steps, "RHC" will be encoded as 2 while "No RHC" will be encoded as 1. Then we deducted it by 1 to get the numeric denotation that we want, which are 1 and 0 respectively.

```{r}
rhc_df$death <- as.numeric(as.factor(rhc_df$death)) -1
rhc_df$RHC <- as.numeric(as.factor(rhc_df$RHC)) - 1
```

Let's check on what the datatypes are now. 

```{r}
str(rhc_df$death)
str(rhc_df$RHC)
```


### Right censoring

One additional problem we need to be aware of when talking about time to event data is 
[censoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)). Censoring is a type of event in which the value of a measurement or observation is only partially known. There are various kinds of censoring, but here we will focus only on right-censoring, which is the most common case in survival analysis.

<center>
![](doc/censoring.png)
</center>

Suppose there are three patients, A, B and C enroll in the study and the period of this study is $T$. Patients A died at time $t_1$ so he requires no censoring since we know his exact survival time; Patients B quit the study at time $t_2$ (where $t_2<T$). There are many possibilities why he quit, such as he changed his phone number, so we can't contact him. In this case, he needs to be censored since we just know he survived until $t_2$, but have no idea of his exact survival time; Patients C was alive at the end of the study, so his survivial time is $T$. However, he also needs to be censored! Why? This is because we still don't know his exact survival time either. Therefore, right censoring can play an important role here: the true survival times will always be equal to or greater than the observed survival time.


### Kaplan Meier (non-parametric)

** add a sentence about why we are using KM curves (right censoring)

The [Kaplan Meier estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan???Meier_estimator) is a non-parametric method used to estimate the survival probability. It is often used to estimate the survival rate stratified by some treatment of interest.

The `Surv()` function in the [`survival`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survival/versions/2.11-4) package uses a specialize class from the `survival` package to create a specialized object. It takes as input both the time to the event (`time`) and whether or not the event has happened by the end of the study (`death`) and then creates an object that describes when right censoring has occurred. 

```{r}
sur_obj <- Surv(rhc_df$time, rhc_df$death) 
sur_obj[1:10]
```

The `sur_obj` can be interpreted by the `survfit()` function from the `survival` package (see below) which is used to compute an estimate of a survival curve for censored data. Do you see `+` behind survival times? This is what we discussed before - right censored data points. 30+ indicates this patient survived until the end of the study while 2 means this patient died at the second day after study began. 

In addition to `sur_obj` object that we created, `survfit()` function also includes as input the response variable of interest in a simple case of right-censored data. Here that is the `RHC` variable. 

```{r}
fit <- survfit(sur_obj ~ RHC, data = rhc_df)

The total number of the patients managed by RHC is `r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)`, and `r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)-fit$n.censor[58]` of them died in 30 days (add code here). The total number of the patients not having RHC is `r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE)`, and `r sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE) - fit$n.censor[29]` of them died in 30 days (add code here too).

To show the survival curve, the `autoplot()` function from the `ggplot2` package can be used to create a Kaplan-Meier for `survfit` objects. We can also use this to show us the survival rate stratified by whether or not a patient was managed with RHC (without any covariates adjustment).

```{r}
p_km <- autoplot(fit, conf.int = FALSE) +
  labs(title = 'Kaplan Meier Plot', 
       y = 'survival probability',
       color = 'RHC', fill = 'RHC') +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("No RHC", "RHC"), 
                     values = c("red", "blue"))
p_km
```

The x-axis is the survival time, and the y-axis is the survival probability. It looks like a step function since the probability changes each day (the data only record the event daily).

Some of the description of the plot: at the beginning, all the patients are alive. The survival probability at the end of 30 days of patients having a right catheterization is `r fit$n.censor[58]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 1, na.rm = TRUE)` and `r fit$n.censor[29]/sum(rhc_df$RHC == 0, na.rm = TRUE)` for patients not having the right catheterization. 

We see the difference in the Kaplan-Meier plot and it seems that patients with RHC treatment have a lower survival rate. But, think back to the 'Data visualization' section. We also saw a difference in the distribution for covariates such as blood pressure. This suggests that patients who are or are not managed by RHC might be different populations of patients. Therefore, the difference in survival rates might be driven by differences in the covariates. Our goal is to determine whether RHC has an impact on survival, but we want to make a fair comparison between the patients managed with and without RHC. Therefore, we are curious if there is still a difference in surival after adjusting for poential confounders with the other variables. To do this, we will introduce propensity scores and propensity score matching in the next few sections as a way to do this. 


## Propensity score matching

As we mentioned above, it is a popular belief that it is beneficial for patients to be managed by RHC [see @fenner2012a]. Therefore, a RCT is more difficult to implement. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8782638) The paper explains this phenomenon like this: 

> "In observational studies, the treatment selection has connection with patients characteristics but also has link with the outcomes. For example, patients with lower blood pressure are more likely to get RHC, and they are also more likely to die. The effect of such treatment selection bias has been called "confounding by indication". 

In the next section, we will introduce propensity scores as a way to treatment selection bias. 

### Propensity scores

** statements about propensity scores
** how people ususally estimate propensity scores? 


### Propensity score matching

To adjust for treatment selection bias, the variables that independently affect the decision to use or withhold the treatment must be identified and measured, that's why we introduce [propensity score matching (PSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching) here.

In a statistical analysis with observational data, PSM is a matching technique that attempts to estimate the effect of a treatment, policy, or other intervention by modeling covariates that predict receiving, for example the treatment. PSM attempts to reduce the bias due to the confounding variables that could be found in an estimate of the treatment effect obtained from simply comparing outcomes among units that received the treatment versus those that did not. 

The general procedures of PSM we would like to use include:

* Run logistic regression:
    + Dependent variable: Y = 1, if with RHC; Y = 0, otherwise.
    + Choose appropriate confounders and apply multivariate logistic regression.
    + Obtain propensity score, which is the predicted probability(p). Higher score indicates a higher probability of receiving the treatment.

* One-to-one matching on propensity score:
    + Randomly select one patient with RHC.
    + Match this patient who has the closest propensity score in all patients with RHC. The difference should less than a certain threshold. (discuss later)
    + Continue this matching until all possible pairs were identified.

</center>

To enhance your understanding, we use a plot to explain it. Each dot represent a sample in the observational study, lying in corresponding line segment(range from 0 to 1). The position reflects the propensity score. The righter it is, the larger propensity score it has. Original dataset includes 3 patients with RHC treatment and 7 patients without RHC treatment. Once we collected the features, logistic regression will be fit and propensity score will be calculated. Next they will be matched based on propensity score. The closer their propensity score are, the more likely they will be matched as a pair. 

There are 3 pairs in the middle: A1 and B1, A2 and B2, A3 and B3, since it is obvious their propensity score are close. However, for No RHC group, 2 samples on the left part and 2 samples on the right part fail to pair up with others. This is because there isn't any sample whose propensity score are close to them. In this case, they fail to be matched and will be removed. Finally, 3 pairs are matched successfully so the matched dataset consist of 3 samples with RHC treatment and 3 samples without RHC treatment.

### Estimate propensity scores

** remind why we are using logistic regression and glm
 
`glm()` function in the [`stats`]() package is a widely used to estimate generalized linear models. The argument `family =` provides a convenient way to specify the details of the models used. Here, we set `binomial(link = "logit")` so it will apply logistic regression.

** why we exclude time and death here 

```{r}
psm_glm <- glm(RHC ~ . - time - death, 
               family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
               data = rhc_df)
```

Using this model, it is easy to calculate the propensity score for each patient. It is simply the patient's predicted probability of receiving RHC, given the estimates from the logit model. Then, we calculated this propensity score with the help of `predict()` and create a data frame that has the propensity score as well as the patient's actual treatment status.

```{r}
glm_df <- data.frame( p_rhc <-  predict(psm_glm, type = "response"),
                     # Predicted probability of being assigned to RHC
                      p_norhc <-  1 - p_rhc,
                     # Predicted probability of being assigned to no RHC
                      RHC <-  psm_glm$model$RHC)
```

inside the data frame, the `p_rhc` is ..., the 

After estimating the propensity score, we can plot the estimated propensity scores by treatment status is using histograms. 

```{r}
glm_df %>%
  mutate(RHC = ifelse(RHC == 1, "RHC", "No RHC")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = p_rhc,fill = RHC, color = RHC)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, position = 'identity')+
  xlab("Probability of receiving RHC before matching") +
  ylab("density") + theme_bw()
```

Note that, you can change the `position` adjustment to use for overlapping points on the layer. Possible values for the argument position are 'identity','stack', 'dodge'. Default value is 'stack'.

It is obvious the distribution of propensity score is not balanced, that's why we will move to the next step: one-to-one matching.


### One-to-one matching on propensity score

The `matchit()` function is the main command of the package [`MatchIt`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/MatchIt.pdf), which uses parametric models for causal inference to select well-matched subsets of the original treated and control groups.

The arguments provided by `matchit()` function are given below:

* `formula`: Specifies the logistic regression formula you would like to use. Here, we just use `psm_glm` that we created in last section.

* `data`: Data frame (or database table name) containing the variables for analysis in the formula arguments.

* `method =`: Specifies the matching methods. Options include:
    + `exact`: Matches each treated unit with a control unit that has exactly the same values on each covariate. It is useless when there are too many variables.
    + `subclass`: Breaks the data set into subclasses so the distributions of the covariates are similar in each subclass.
    + `nearest`: Matches a pair that is closest in terms of a distance measure. It is the default method.
    + `optimal`: Minimize the average absolute distance across all matched pairs.
 
* `caliper`: Nearest neighbor matching has a further restriction that the absolute difference in the propensity scores of matched subjects must be below some prespecified threshold (the `caliper` distance). [Cochran and Rubin (1973)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144483/#s5title) suggested using a caliper size of one-fifth of a standard deviation of the sample estimated propensity scores.

* `ratio`: Indicates the ratio of treatment cases to control cases to match. Default is one-to-one matching. You can increase the number of control cases matched to each treatment case by increasing this number; usually this number is between 1 and 5.

To specify the value of `caliper`, the standard deviation of the logit odds of estimated propensity scores is necessary. That is what we calculated in previous section. `p_rhc` will come into useful now!

```{r}
epsilon <- 0.2*sd(log(p_rhc/(1-p_rhc)))

psm_mod <- matchit( RHC ~ age + sex + race + education +
           income + med_ins + disease + cancer +
           weight + temp + bp + resp + hrt + pf +
           pc + ph, data = rhc_df, method = "nearest", 
           caliper  = epsilon, ratio = 1)

rhc_psm_df <- match.data(psm_mod)
#head(rhc_psm_df)
```

Using `match.data()` function, we can get the final dataset, `rhc_psm_df`. Note that the final dataset is smaller than the original: it contains `r dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` observations, meaning that `r 0.5*dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` pairs of treated and control observations were matched. It also contains a variable called `distance`, which is the propensity score.  

```{r}
rhc_psm_df %>%
  mutate(RHC = ifelse(RHC == 1, "RHC", "No RHC")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = distance,fill = RHC, color = RHC)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = 'identity') +
  xlab("Probability of receiving RHC after matching") +
  ylab('density') + theme_bw()

```

Now the distribution of propensity scores are much more balanced! In addition to plot by yourself, there is another way to implement the result using the `plot()` function inside .

```{r}
plot(psm_mod,type = "hist" )
```

Just putting the model name in `plot()` can offer you a nice plot, showing the overall comparison. It shows the histograms of distribution of propensity scores before and after matching. The histograms before matching on the left differ, but the histograms after matching on the right are more similar


## Cox Proportional Hazard Model

In logistic regression, we know that whether an event is going to happen or not, and you could see survival analysis as an updated version of logistic regression where you could see when that event would happen.

Cox proportional hazards model is a class of parametric survival models in statistics. Different with Kaplan Meier model, except for variables like the time that passes, the event occurs, it also includes other covariates that used to adjust the association of survival rate and time.

A fundamental assumption of the cox proportional hazards model is that the model assumes the hazard is constant with the time passing by.

### Theoretical Concepts

#### 1. Survival Function

Let $T$ represent survival time and we regard it as a continuous random variable. Its cumulative distribution function is

$$P(t) = Pr(T \leq t)$$

The complement of the distribution function is survival function $S(t)$

$$S(t) = Pr(T>t) = 1 - P(t)$$

To simplify, the survival rate equal to the probability of surviving at time t or one minus the probability of dying at time t.

Besides $f(t) = P(t=T)$, so 

$$S(t)= \int_{t}^{\infty}f(t)dt$$
$$f(t)=-\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$$

#### 2. Hazard Function

It describes the probability of an event or its hazard $h(t)$ if the patient survived up to that particular time point $t$.

$$h(t) =\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \Delta t}} \frac{ P(t \leq T <t+\Delta t|T \ge t)}{\Delta t}$$

$$h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}=-\frac{dln[S(t)]}{dt}$$
a related quantity is the cumulative hazard function hazard function $H(t)$, defined by,

$$H(t)=\int_{0}^{t}h(u)du=-ln[S(t)]$$
Thus, for continuous lifetimes,
$$S(t)=exp[-H(t)]=exp[-\int_{0}^{t}h(u)du]$$

Properties of Hazard Function are given below:

+ non-increasing

+ survival rate at time 0 equal to 1

+ survival probability at time infinity equal to 0

+ the hazard function assumes proportional hazard meaning that the hazard is constant


#### 3. Linear-like Model

Our goal is to investigate the survival distribution with consideration of all other covariates. This examination entails the specification of a linear-like model for the log hazard:

$$log~h(t)= \alpha+\beta~X $$
or equivalently,

$$h(t)= exp(\alpha+\beta~X )$$
where $\beta$ is the coefficients matrix and the $X$ is the covariates matrix.

If we set a baseline function $h_0(t) = \alpha$, we can estimate the hazard function like this:

$$h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta X}$$
#### 4. Other resources

Besides cox proportional hazard model, other parameteric models for survival data are preferable under different circumstances. Here we would like to give a brief description on one specific model: [complementary log log model](http://www.stat.ualberta.ca/~kcarrier/STAT562/comp_log_log)  

An alternative extension of the proportional hazards model to discrete time starts from the survival function, which in a proportional hazards framework can be written as:

$$S(t_j)=Pr(T \geq t_j)=\sum_{i=j}^{\infty}Pr(T=t_i)$$

$T$ is a  discrete random variable that takes the value$t_1<t_2<...$. The relationship between sirvival function and hazard function can be written like:

$$S(t_j)=(1-h_{t_1})(1-h_{t_2})...(1-h_{t_{j-1}})$$

In this case, another link function is more suitable than log hazard:

$$log(-log(1-h(t_j)))=\alpha_j+X_{j}\beta$$
where $\alpha_j=log(-log(1-h_0(t_j)))$ is the baseline hazard function and $X_{j}$ is the covariate matrix for patient $j$

When should we use it? Complementary log-log model is asymmetrical, it is frequently used when the probability of an event is very small or very large.



### Model Application

The Cox proportional hazards model is fitted by `coxph()` function, located in `survival` package. Simariliy, we also need to create a survival object first and then fit the model.

Just notice the structure of `rhc_psm_df`. Besides the origin variables, `rhc_psm_df` also includes propensity socre and weight calcuated by `matchit()`, which we do not need in model fitting. So we remove unecessary variables and fit the model with all the other variables.

```{r}
fit1 <- coxph(Surv(time, death) ~ . - time - death -
              distance - weights, 
              data = rhc_psm_df)
res <- tidy(fit1)
head(res)
```
The `tidy()` function in the `broom` package provides a dataframe representation of the model's output. We just show the head of it here but you are encouraged to research more if you are interested in!

The coefficients are interpretable as multiplicative effects on the hazard. If the exponentiated coefficient is larger than 1, the variable will increase the survival probability and vice versa.

Thus, for example, holding the other covariates constant, an additional year of age increases the monthly hazard of death by `r (exp(res[1,2])-1)` on average. Similarly, compared with female, male have `r (exp(res[2,2])-1)` increased monthly hazard of death.


### Adjusted Survival Plot

Having fit a Cox proportional hazards model to the data, it is often of interest to examine the estimated distribution of survival times. The `survfit()` function estimates $S(t)$, by default at the mean values of the covariates.

We could estimate the new survival plot by inputting the main predictor `RHC`. We first code all `RHC` as 0 to predict the survival rate for 'No RHC' group, and input all `RHC` as 1 to predict the survival rate for 'RHC' group.

```{r}
rhc0 <- rhc1 <- rhc_psm_df
rhc0$RHC <- 0
rhc1$RHC <- 1
```

```{r}
time0 <- survfit(fit1, newdata = rhc0)$surv
time1 <- survfit(fit1, newdata = rhc1)$surv

dim(time0)

dat.time <- data.frame(t0 = rowMeans(time0),
                       t1 = rowMeans(time1))
```

`time0` is the survival time of 'No RHC' group while `time1` is the survival time of 'RHC' group for `r dim(time0)[2]` observations in `r dim(time0)[1]` days. To plot the mothly survival trend as a whole, we take mean of `r dim(time0)[2]` observations for two groups, and plot it with function `geom_step()`.


```{r}

p_cox <- ggplot(dat.time) +
  geom_step(aes(x =1:length(dat.time$t0),
                y = t0, col = 'red')) +
  geom_step(aes(x =1:length(dat.time$t1),
                y = t1, col = 'blue')) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(colour="Strata", x = "survival time", 
                         y = "survival probability", colour = 'RHC',  
                         title = 'Survival Plot after adjustment') +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("RHC", "No RHC"), 
                     values = c("blue", "red"))


ggarrange(p_km, p_cox, ncol=2)

```
Function `theme_minimal()` gives us a minimalistic theme with no background annotations. 

The final plot indicates that after adjusting the covariates, patients in RHC group still have lower survival rate than No RHC group. However, the difference between these two groups is not that large compared with unadjusted result. The result after adjusting all covariates shows that RHC is less harmful than without modification.


# Summary

In this case study, we mainly revealed the association between time to death in 30 days and RHC based on an observational dataset. We covered various fields to deal with this situation, such as survival analysis, propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards model. In conclusion, RHC has a positive relationship with risk of mortality even though we applied adjustment. 

At first we separated the dataset in two groups, No RHC group and RHC group, based on the variable `RHC`. We gave a table to show the distribution of all variables in two groups and found some of them have large difference while others do not vary too much. Then we tried Kaplan Meier method, a non-parametric method, to find the relationship of survival rate and whether a patient receive RHC treatment or not. The result was shown as a survival curve plot. It provided us an initial understanding that survival rate is significantly better in population managed without RHC treatment. 

But, since it is an observational dataset, the bias in treatment selection is an unavoidable problem, resulting in lower accuracy. To solve it, we made use of a causal inference method: propensity score matching. Logistic regression was applied to determine the probability of receiving RHC (propensity score). It represented the relationship between multiple covariates and the use of RHC and was used as a criteria to match. We matched observation based on propensity score and finally kept `r 0.5*dim(rhc_psm_df)[1]` pairs. As expected, the outcomes was pretty successful considering a much more balanced distribution of propensity score in two groups.

In the next step, we further improved our survival analysis model by using a parametric method: Cox proportional hazards model. All necessary variables were included, avoiding that we may ingore potential risks. Adjusted outcomes matched unadjusted outcomes: Patients with RHC treatment are less likely to survive in 30 days. Nevertheless, RHC treatment was not that harmful with adjustment, proving the necessity of what we did.

There also exists much more space for further improvement such as variable selection and model engineering. There was never enough work on how to include more influential variables. Additionally, our outcomes seem to be opposite to the widespread belief that RHC is recommended in broad clinical application, this may be caused by the confounding variables which increase the probability of receiving RHC and the probability of death overall. We admit the limitation of this study and would like to receive more suggestion to better understand the role of RHC.
